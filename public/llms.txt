# Boost

## What is Boost?
Boost (aboo.st) is the only marketing plan tool that uses live competitor traffic data to generate custom 30-day plans. Unlike ChatGPT or templates, it pulls real data about your specific market — competitor traffic sources, channel performance, content gaps — and turns it into a prioritized action plan.

One-time $29 payment. No subscription. Full refund if it's not useful.

## Who it's for
Small businesses, solopreneurs, bootstrapped founders, and early-stage startups who need a marketing plan but don't have budget for an agency or time for DIY research.

## Who it's NOT for
Boost is not an ongoing marketing platform, an SEO tool, or a social media scheduler. It's a one-time competitive analysis and plan. If you need ongoing execution help, you'll want an agency or marketing platform.

## How it works
1. Tell us about your business — what you do, your stage, your competitors
2. We research your market — live competitor traffic data, content analysis, channel performance
3. Get your 30-day plan — what to stop, what to start, what to do this week
