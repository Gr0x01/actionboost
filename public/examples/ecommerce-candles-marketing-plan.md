# Marketing Plan: Wick & Flame Co.

**Premium Handmade Candles | Shopify Store**

---

## Executive Summary

You are doing $15K/month selling premium handmade candles with almost all traffic coming from Instagram. That is both your strength and your risk. One algorithm change, one account issue, and you lose 70%+ of revenue overnight.

The good news: your product photos are strong, your price point ($38-52) matches the premium market, and you have 127 five-star reviews. You have the foundation to scale.

**The core problem:** You are competing for the same Instagram eyeballs as Brooklyn Candle Studio (480K followers), Homesick (380K), and Boy Smells (290K). You will not out-spend them. You need to find channels where your handmade story and smaller batch sizes become advantages, not limitations.

**Your Growth Flywheel:**

```
Content (Pinterest/SEO)
        ↓
    Discovery
        ↓
    Email Capture (quiz/popup)
        ↓
    Nurture Sequence
        ↓
    First Purchase
        ↓
    UGC + Review Request
        ↓
    Social Proof → More Content
```

**Top 3 Recommendations:**
1. Launch Pinterest with 30 pins in week one. Your aesthetic is perfect for this platform.
2. Set up Klaviyo abandonment and post-purchase flows. You are leaving $2-4K/month on the table.
3. Create a candle subscription for your top 20% repeat customers. Predictable revenue changes everything.

## Your Situation

### What You Have Going For You

**Product-Market Fit Signals:**
- 127 reviews, 4.9 average rating
- 23% repeat purchase rate (industry avg: 18%)
- $48 AOV with 62% gross margin
- Strong visual brand (this matters for Pinterest/social)

**Current Channel Mix:**
| Channel | % of Revenue | Trend |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Instagram (organic) | 58% | Flat |
| Instagram (paid) | 14% | Declining ROAS |
| Direct/Referral | 18% | Growing |
| Google (organic) | 7% | Slow growth |
| Email | 3% | Under-utilized |

**Your AARRR Snapshot:**

| Stage | Status | Gap |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Acquisition | Instagram-dependent | Need 2-3 more channels |
| Activation | Strong (good site, clear value) | Quiz could boost conversion |
| Retention | 23% repurchase | No subscription, weak email |
| Referral | None active | No program, no program |
| Revenue | $48 AOV | Bundle strategy could lift 15-20% |

### The Real Problem

Your Instagram paid ROAS dropped from 4.2x to 2.1x over 6 months. iOS privacy changes hit hard. You are spending $1,800/month on Meta ads with diminishing returns while competitors with bigger budgets drown out your reach.

Meanwhile, you have zero email automation beyond a welcome discount. Your 8,400 email subscribers are sitting there, untouched. Based on industry benchmarks, proper Klaviyo flows could generate $3,200-4,800/month in attributed revenue.

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitor Analysis

| Competitor | Est. Monthly Traffic | Top Traffic Source | Avg. Price | Positioning |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Brooklyn Candle Studio | 89K | Pinterest (34%) | $34 | Minimalist, Brooklyn aesthetic |
| Homesick Candles | 156K | Paid Search (28%) | $44 | Nostalgia, location-based scents |
| Boy Smells | 112K | Instagram (31%) | $39 | Gender-neutral, bold branding |
| **You** | ~4K | Instagram (72%) | $45 | Handmade, small batch |

### What They Are Doing That Works

**Brooklyn Candle Studio:**
- Pinterest drives 34% of their traffic (30K+ monthly visits)
- 847 pins, averaging 2.1K monthly views per pin
- Heavy on lifestyle photography, not just product shots
- "Apartment candle" keyword ranking position 3

**Homesick Candles:**
- Paid search on state/city names ("Texas candle", "NYC candle")
- Location-specific landing pages for 50 states
- Gifting angle drives 40%+ of Q4 revenue
- Email list estimated at 180K with aggressive popup

**Boy Smells:**
- Influencer seeding program (send free product, no payment)
- TikTok presence (287K followers) driving younger demo
- Collaboration drops create urgency and buzz
- Strong Earned Media (Vogue, GQ, Architectural Digest)

### Keyword Opportunities

| Keyword | Monthly Volume | Difficulty | Current Ranking | Opportunity |
|---------|---------------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| "handmade candles" | 8,100 | Medium | Not ranking | Blog + collection page |
| "soy candles" | 14,800 | High | Page 3 | Long-tail variants |
| "candle subscription box" | 4,400 | Low | Not ranking | Create offer + page |
| "small batch candles" | 1,900 | Low | Not ranking | Your positioning |
| "non-toxic candles" | 6,600 | Medium | Not ranking | If applicable |

Brooklyn Candle Studio ranks for 2,847 keywords. You rank for 89. That is a content gap you can close.

## Stop Doing

### 1. Stop Boosting Instagram Posts

You spent $420 last month boosting posts with a 0.8x ROAS. Boosted posts optimize for engagement, not purchases. Either run proper conversion campaigns or stop entirely.

**Redirect:** Put that $420/month into Pinterest ads once you have organic traction (month 2-3).

### 2. Stop Posting Instagram Carousels Daily

Your data shows carousels get 340 avg. reach vs. Reels at 2,100. You are spending 45 minutes per carousel for diminishing returns. The algorithm has moved on.

**Redirect:** 3 Reels per week beats 7 carousels. Focus on behind-the-scenes pouring process and satisfying wax shots.

### 3. Stop Running Sales Every Month

You did a sale in October, November, December, and January. You are training customers to wait. Your margins cannot handle it, and your premium positioning suffers.

**Redirect:** Two sales per year maximum (Black Friday, your anniversary). Replace with limited drops and exclusive scents.

---

## Start Doing

### 1. Launch Pinterest (High Impact, Medium Effort)

**Why:** Brooklyn Candle Studio gets 30K monthly visits from Pinterest. Your aesthetic photography is already Pinterest-ready. This is the lowest-hanging fruit for a visual product like yours.

**What to do:**
- Convert Instagram best-performers to Pinterest pins
- Create 5 boards: Home Decor, Self Care Rituals, Gift Ideas, Behind the Scenes, Seasonal Scents
- Pin 5x per day using Tailwind ($15/month)
- Add Rich Pins for product data

**Expected impact:** 800-1,500 monthly visitors within 90 days, scaling to 5K+ by month 6.

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Impact | 8/10 |
| Confidence | 7/10 |
| Ease | 6/10 |
| ICE Score | 7.0 |

### 2. Implement Klaviyo Email Flows (High Impact, High Ease)

**Why:** Your 8,400 subscribers are generating almost nothing. Industry benchmark for DTC email: 25-30% of revenue. You are at 3%.

**Critical flows to build:**
1. **Abandoned Cart** (3 emails) - Recovers 5-15% of abandoned carts
2. **Post-Purchase** (4 emails) - Review request, care tips, cross-sell, referral ask
3. **Browse Abandonment** (2 emails) - "Still thinking about [product]?"
4. **Win-Back** (3 emails) - Re-engage 60-90 day inactive

**Expected impact:** $3,200-4,800/month in email-attributed revenue within 60 days.

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Impact | 9/10 |
| Confidence | 9/10 |
| Ease | 7/10 |
| ICE Score | 8.3 |

### 3. Create a Candle Subscription (High Impact, Medium Effort)

**Why:** Homesick has "The Homesick Club." Brooklyn Candle has "The Candle of the Month." Your repeat customers (23%) are asking for this with their behavior.

**Structure:**
- $36/month (8% discount from avg. single price)
- Seasonal scent curation, subscriber-exclusive
- Free shipping (baked into price)
- 3-month minimum commitment

**Expected impact:** If 5% of your email list converts (420 subscribers), that is $15,120/month in predictable recurring revenue.

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Impact | 9/10 |
| Confidence | 6/10 |
| Ease | 5/10 |
| ICE Score | 6.7 |

### 4. Launch UGC Collection System (Medium Impact, High Ease)

**Why:** You have 127 reviews but almost no customer photos on your site. User-generated content converts 4.5x better than brand photography for DTC.

**What to do:**
- Add post-purchase email asking for photo with incentive ($5 off next order)
- Create branded hashtag: #WickAndFlameHome
- Install Loox or Okendo for photo reviews ($29-99/month)
- Feature UGC on product pages and homepage

**Expected impact:** 15-25% lift in conversion rate on product pages with UGC.

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Impact | 7/10 |
| Confidence | 8/10 |
| Ease | 8/10 |
| ICE Score | 7.7 |

## Quick Wins

Do these three things this week. No excuses.

### Monday-Tuesday: Fix Your Pop-up

Your current popup offers 10% off for email signup. It converts at 1.2% (industry avg: 3-5%).

**Change to a quiz popup:**
"Find Your Signature Scent" - 3 questions, email at end, personalized recommendation.
Use Octane AI or Typeform embedded. Quiz popups convert 5-8% and give you segmentation data.

Time: 2-3 hours with a template.

### Wednesday-Thursday: Set Up Abandoned Cart Flow

You are losing $2,100/month in abandoned carts (based on your 68% abandonment rate and $48 AOV).

**3-email sequence:**
1. Hour 1: "You left something behind" (product image, no discount)
2. Hour 24: "Still thinking it over?" (social proof, customer quote)
3. Hour 72: "Last chance" (10% discount, urgency)

Klaviyo has templates. Time: 3-4 hours.

### Friday: Batch Create 30 Pinterest Pins

Take your top 30 Instagram posts from the last year. Reformat for Pinterest (2:3 ratio, text overlay, keyword-rich descriptions). Schedule using Tailwind.

Time: 4-5 hours including Tailwind setup.
