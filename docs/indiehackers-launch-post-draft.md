## Post

I was stuck on another project, product built and on our favorite step, getting the word out. I ran through claude and chatgpt and got, "have you tried content marketing", "build an email list", "focus on seo".

Bet. Thanks.

I've been working with a bunch of api's on that project—web search, seo data, scraping. I realized that maybe if I frankensteined some stuff together, I'd get a better response. I fed claude actual data about my competitors, traffic numbers, real research instead of just my description. That was it.

"You built an ambassador program, share buttons, referral tracking—all before you have a single claimed profile or paying customer. These are optimization features for channels that don't exist yet." Bro, I almost cried.

It told me I was targeting the wrong people. That my competitors were getting traffic from communities I hadn't considered. It found where my users actually were (I thought pinterest was dead, but I was wrong).

I kept following it. Started noticing the same growth questions everywhere, so I built it into a thing other people could use: actionboo.st

It worked well for my other project, and to test the output, I'm going to follow it. It told me to:

- Stop hiding and add my face to the site. Done.
- Build out a free version of the flow. Done.
- Post our Action Plan in public. Done.

So now I'm following an ai generated growth hacking plan to see if it actually works. For step 3, it said to give out some promo codes for y'all to try the full version. REDDIT is good for the first 100 users. Enjoy!

**Title:** Week 0: Following an growth hacking plan to see if it works

---

## Post

I built an ai tool that writes growth hacking plans. Now I'm going to follow its advice and post what happens.

**Background:** I was stuck on another project. Had the product, needed growth. Asked ChatGPT and Claude for ideas, got the usual "have you tried content marketing?" stuff. Useless.

I'd been working with a bunch of APIs—web search, SEO data, scraping—so I frankensteined them together. Fed Claude actual competitor data, traffic numbers, real research instead of just my description.

The output hit different. Told me I was targeting the wrong people. Found communities I hadn't considered. One line that got me: "You built an ambassador program, share buttons, referral tracking—all before you have a single paying customer. These are optimization features for channels that don't exist yet."

I kept using it, eventually built it into something others could use ([actionboo.st](https://actionboo.st)).

**The experiment:** I ran it on itself. Here's what it told me to do:

Week 1:
- Stop hiding, add my face to the site ✓
- Publish the growth plan publicly ✓
- Post to communities (this post)
- Start engaging on Reddit daily

Week 2-4:
- Build a free mini version
- Launch on Product Hunt
- Track everything, share the numbers

**What I'll share:**
- Traffic numbers (starting from ~0)
- What channels actually convert
- What advice was wrong
- Revenue if any happens

This is Week 0. I'll post updates as I go.

If you want to try it and tell me if the output is actually useful, code **REDDIT20** should work. Not trying to sell anything here—genuinely want to know if this helps people or if I'm just building for myself.

## Notes for editing

- [ ] Confirm REDDIT20 code is active
- [ ] Add link to the published growth plan if live
- [ ] Consider adding starting metrics (current traffic, revenue = $0, etc.)
- [ ] Add Twitter/X handle for people who want updates outside Reddit
