# V2 Vision: Raw Thinking

*Captured Jan 21, 2026 - pre-PMF brainstorm, not commitments*

## The Core Reframe

**v1**: Pay $9.99, get a strategy document.
**v2**: Subscribe for an ongoing relationship with a strategist that remembers.

The document is just the first artifact. The real value:
- Knows what you tried
- Knows what worked
- Adapts when you learn something new
- Compounds over time

**Selling "a strategy" vs "a strategist."** Transaction vs relationship.

## The Data Flywheel

At scale (100, 1000, 10000 users), aggregate intelligence becomes the moat.

If founders are running 30-day plans and reporting "this worked / this flopped," we're sitting on something rare: **advice informed by what actually worked for people like you.**

Not just AI advice. Pattern-matched, outcome-validated advice.

### What to capture now (even pre-scale):
- Structured outcome tracking (did tactic work? what results?)
- Cohort tagging (stage, industry, business model, primary channel)
- Before/after metrics when possible

Don't build the flywheel yet. Build the data capture that enables it.

## The Actionable UI

Current: Markdown document. Good for reading, bad for doing.

Vision: 30-day plan that lives.

### Key features:
1. **Checkable tasks** - Week-by-week breakdown, mark progress
2. **Mid-flight pivots** - "Just realized we need to add SEO" → drops in, reintegrates with whole picture
3. **Weekly check-ins** - "How'd Week 1 go?" → captures context for next update
4. **Results tracking** - "Did this work?" after marking complete

The insight: value isn't in the UI, it's in the **continuity**. Users want someone tracking progress with them.

## Pricing Evolution

### Current thinking:

| Layer | What | Price |
|-------|------|-------|
| Lead gen | Free mini-audit | $0 |
| Qualification | Full one-shot run | $9.99 |
| Subscription | Ongoing relationship | $29/mo |
| Expansion | + Q&A, integrations | $49/mo |

### Key decisions:
- **Keep $9.99** as qualification filter (someone who pays once is 10x more likely to subscribe than free user)
- Subscription value = continuity + accountability, not "more runs"
- 1 free full run/month might be "enough" for users → dangerous

### $29/mo would include:
- Weekly progress check-in
- 2 full refreshes per month
- Tracking UI with checkboxes
- Email digest

### $49/mo adds:
- Async Q&A (reply to ask questions)
- Priority response
- Integrations (Notion, Slack)

## Build Order (When Ready)

1. **Structured 30-day plan UI** - Parse roadmap to JSON, checkboxes, week view
2. **"Add to plan" quick input** - Test mid-flight pivot hypothesis
3. **Weekly check-in flow** - Email → form → captures for next refresh
4. **Subscription infrastructure** - Only after check-ins validate

---

## Open Questions

- Are $9.99 users the subscription audience? Or "help me once" buyers?
- How many users need weekly updates vs one good strategy every 3-6 months?
- Support load at $49 with async Q&A - sustainable solo?
- What's the churn pattern after first big win?

---

## The Moat

Not the AI. Everyone has AI.

The moat is: **accumulated context + outcome data across users.**

"We've seen 500 B2B SaaS founders try Twitter threads. Here's what actually moved the needle."

That's defensible.
