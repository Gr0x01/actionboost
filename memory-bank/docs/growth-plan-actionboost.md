# Actionboo.st Growth Plan

**AI Growth Strategist for Startups and Entrepreneurs**

*Updated: January 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

Actionboo.st occupies a unique position in the AI tools landscape: **cheaper than a consultant, smarter than ChatGPT, faster than DIY**. The product's core differentiators -- live competitive research before advice, time investment before payment, and Claude Opus 4.5's superior reasoning -- create a defensible moat that generic AI assistants cannot replicate.

**The primary growth challenge is discoverability, not product-market fit.** The product works. The economics work (~$0.50 cost per $9.99 sale = 95% margin). The challenge is getting Actionboo.st in front of founders at the exact moment they're stuck on growth.

### North Star Metric

## 1. Target Audience Analysis

### Primary Persona: The Stuck Founder

**Demographics:**
- Solo founders, indie hackers, early-stage startup founders (1-3 people)
- Age 25-45, tech-savvy, bootstrapped or lightly funded
- Revenue: $0-$50K MRR (mostly $0-$10K)
- Stage: Post-launch, pre-product-market fit

**Psychographics:**
- Overwhelmed by conflicting growth advice
- Burned by generic "just post more content" recommendations
- Time-poor, action-oriented, skeptical of consultants
- Active in communities: Indie Hackers, Twitter/X #buildinpublic, Reddit (r/startups, r/SaaS)
- Uses AI tools but knows ChatGPT gives surface-level advice


**Pain Points:**
- "I launched, got 100 users, and now I'm stuck"
- "I don't know which growth channel to prioritize"
- "I can't afford a growth consultant"
- "ChatGPT gives the same advice to everyone"
- "I'm drowning in tactics but have no strategy"

**Jobs to Be Done:**
1. **Functional**: Get a prioritized list of growth tactics specific to my situation
2. **Emotional**: Feel confident I'm working on the right things
3. **Social**: Look competent when discussing growth with co-founders/investors

### Market Size and Timing

The solo founder segment is expanding rapidly:
- Solo-founded startups rose from 22% (2015) to 42% (2025) per MicroConf data
- 58% of founders experienced burnout in the past year -- they need strategic clarity, not more tactics
- AI enables one person to do the work of a small team, but founders still lack strategic direction

**Why Now?**
- ChatGPT commoditized generic advice; specialized, research-backed tools are the next wave
- 65% of SaaS companies now identify as product-led (up from 35% in 2021)
- The "growth advice industrial complex" (courses, gurus, expensive consultants) is ripe for disruption
- In 2026, AI startups attract 38% of total VC funding -- founders are more AI-savvy and discerning
- Perplexity, ChatGPT Search, and AI Overviews are changing how founders discover tools

### Secondary Personas

**The Side Project Builder**
- Full-time job, building on nights/weekends
- Maximum 5 hours/week for growth work
- Needs the most efficient path, not comprehensive strategy
- Price-sensitive but will pay for time savings

**The Pivot Explorer**
- Has an existing product that's not working
- Considering a pivot or repositioning
- Needs competitive analysis to validate new direction
- Willing to invest $9.99 to avoid months of wrong-direction building

**The Vibe Coder**
- New persona emerging in 2025-2026
- Building with AI tools (Cursor, Replit, Bolt)
- Can ship products fast but has no marketing/growth background
- Perfect target: technical capability, growth knowledge gap

## 2. Positioning and Differentiation

### Positioning Statement

> For startup founders who are stuck after launch, Actionboo.st is an AI growth strategist that delivers a personalized 30-day playbook based on live competitive research. Unlike ChatGPT or expensive consultants, we research YOUR competitors and prioritize tactics by impact, not guesswork.

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Model | Price | Actionboo.st Advantage |
|------------|-------|-------|------------------------|
| ChatGPT/Claude direct | Chat | $20/mo | No live research, no structure, no prioritization |
| Perplexity | Research + chat | $20/mo | Raw research, no strategy synthesis |
| RivalHunt | Competitor tracking | $49/mo | Tracks competitors but doesn't give strategy |
| MakerBox | Toolkit + prompts | $149 one-time | Broad toolkit, not personalized strategy |
| Generic consultants | Hourly | $150-500/hr | 10-100x price, slower turnaround |
| DIY (Perplexity + prompts) | Manual | Free-$20 | Requires expertise to synthesize |
| Clarity.fm calls | Per-minute | $50-300/call | Inconsistent quality, no research |
| Swipe Files / First 1000 | Templates | $50-200 | Generic templates, not personalized |

### Key Differentiators

1. **Live Competitive Research**: Tavily + DataForSEO pull real traffic data, keywords, and backlinks. ChatGPT cannot do this.

2. **Time-Before-Money Model**: 5-10 minute form creates psychological commitment. Conversion rate is higher because users are invested before seeing the price.

3. **AARRR Framework**: Recognized methodology builds instant credibility. Users can return for different focus areas (acquisition, retention, monetization).

4. **Claude Opus 4.5 Reasoning**: Not a fine-tuned model or prompt wrapper -- genuine frontier AI that provides nuanced, unexpected recommendations.

5. **No Friction**: No account required. Magic link for later access. One payment, done.

6. **Output Quality**: 10-section structured playbook with day-by-day tactics, not a wall of text.

### Brand Voice

**Personality**: The founder friend who's three steps ahead. Blunt optimist. Research nerd. Allergic to guru culture.

| We sound like | We don't sound like |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Someone who's done this | Marketing agency |
| Cuts to the chase | LinkedIn influencer |
| Founder friend 3 steps ahead | Enterprise SaaS |
| Direct and specific | Vague and hedging |

**Words we use:** stop, start, actually, specific, tactics, real, this week, execute, plan

**Words we avoid:** leverage, optimize, scale, transform, journey, solution, cutting-edge, empower, unlock

## 3. Acquisition Channels and Tactics

### Channel Priority Matrix (Solo Developer Optimized)

| Channel | Effort/Week | Time to Results | CAC | Scalability | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|-----|-------------|----------|
| Indie Hackers | 3-5 hrs | 1-4 weeks | $0 | Medium | **HIGH** |
| Reddit | 3-5 hrs | 2-8 weeks | $0 | Medium | **HIGH** |
| Twitter/X #buildinpublic | 5-7 hrs | 4-12 weeks | $0 | High | **HIGH** |

| Short-Form Video | 4-6 hrs | 4-12 weeks | $0 | High | **MEDIUM** |
| Newsletter Sponsors | 1-2 hrs | 1-2 weeks | $10-50 | Low | **TEST** |
| Product Hunt | 8-16 hrs (one-time) | One-day spike | $0 | Low | **WAIT** |

---

### Channel 1: Indie Hackers (PRIMARY)

**Why it matters**: Indie Hackers delivers a 20-25% conversion rate per engaged post -- 3-8x better than Product Hunt. But IH isn't a launch platform; it's a community-building strategy.

**ICE Score: 8/9/8 = 25** (High priority)

**Strategy: The 90/10 Rule**
- 90% of activity is value-first (answering questions, sharing insights)
- 10% is subtle product mentions when genuinely relevant

**Tactical Playbook:**

**Week 1-2: Establish Presence**
- Complete profile with actionboo.st link
- Post introduction: "I built an AI growth strategist. AMA."
- Engage with 10+ posts daily, providing genuine value
- Focus on "roast my startup" threads with real feedback

**Week 3-4: Launch Post**
- Title: "We ran our AI growth tool on ourselves. Here's the full strategy."
- Include: Problem, solution, sample output screenshot, behind-the-scenes metrics
- Use INDIEHACKERS promo code for tracking
- Schedule for Tuesday/Wednesday 9-11am EST (peak engagement)

**Ongoing: Weekly Value Posts**
- Share one growth insight per week (from actual runs, anonymized)
- "Growth Roast" series: analyze public indie products
- Answer growth questions with depth, not just links

**Content Templates:**

```markdown
[LAUNCH POST TEMPLATE]

Happy to answer any questions about the build, the strategy, or the results.
```

```markdown
[WEEKLY VALUE POST TEMPLATE]
Title: I analyzed 50 indie hackers' growth strategies. Here are the 3 patterns that separate winners from stuck founders.

I've been running growth analyses for startups. After 50+ runs, patterns emerge.

**Pattern 1: [Insight]**

**Pattern 2: [Insight]**
[2-3 sentences with specific example]

**Pattern 3: [Insight]**
[2-3 sentences with specific example]

The tool I use: [subtle mention with value-add]

What patterns have you noticed?
```

**Expected Results**: 30-100 trials in first month, community reputation established

---

### Channel 2: Reddit (PRIMARY)

**Why it matters**: Reddit is the #2 most-visited site via Google search traffic in the US. Over 700 million Google searches per month end up on Reddit threads. AI chatbots (ChatGPT, Perplexity) heavily cite Reddit content. One founder documented finding 47 B2B customers on Reddit without ads or spam.

**ICE Score: 7/8/7 = 22** (High priority)

**Target Subreddits:**

| Subreddit | Members | Intent Level | Strategy |
|-----------|---------|--------------|----------|
| r/startups | 2.2M | High | General startup discussion, AMAs |
| r/SaaS | 180K | Very High | SaaS-specific, direct target audience |
| r/Entrepreneur | 4M | Medium | Broad reach, higher volume |
| r/indiehackers | 110K | Very High | Exact target audience |
| r/SideProject | 220K | High | Side project builders |
| r/GrowthHacking | 190K | Very High | Growth-focused |
| r/EntrepreneurRideAlong | 350K | High | Bootstrapped founders |

**Strategy: Genuine Participation First**

**Phase 1: Build Karma (Weeks 1-4)**
- 20 minutes/day answering growth questions
- Never mention product initially
- Build reputation as helpful growth expert
- Target 500+ comment karma before any self-promotion

**Phase 2: Contextual Mentions (Week 5+)**
- When someone asks "how do I analyze my competitors," mention: "I actually built a tool for this" with link
- Always lead with value, never lead with pitch
- One self-promo per 20+ value comments

**Phase 3: Strategic Posts (Month 2+)**
- "I built an AI growth strategist. Here's what I learned."
- Share sample output with permission
- AMAs in r/SaaS or r/startups

**High-Value Comment Templates:**

```markdown
[GROWTH QUESTION RESPONSE]
The #1 mistake I see here is trying to do everything at once.

Here's a quick prioritization framework:
1. What channel brought your first 10 users? Double down there first.
2. List every growth tactic you've tried. Rate each on effort vs results.
3. Kill anything that's high effort, low results.

For your specific situation:
[Personalized advice based on their post]

I've been documenting these patterns - happy to share more if helpful.
```

```markdown
[COMPETITOR ANALYSIS RESPONSE]
Good question. Here's how I'd approach competitor analysis:

**Step 1: Traffic Sources**
Use SimilarWeb free tier to see their top channels. Usually reveals 1-2 you're ignoring.

**Step 2: Content Strategy**
Look at their blog post frequency and topics. What's getting shared?

**Step 3: Positioning**
Screenshot their homepage. What's their core promise? How is yours different?

For [their specific product], I'd focus on [specific advice].
```

**Important**: Reddit punishes obvious marketing. Accounts get banned for excessive self-promotion. The 90/10 rule is mandatory.

**Expected Results**: 5-20 conversions/month with zero ad spend; builds compound reputation

---

### Channel 3: Twitter/X #buildinpublic (PRIMARY)

**Why it matters**: The #buildinpublic community is 600K+ founders who celebrate transparency. Building in public "open sources" your problems, which attracts audiences who can offer support and opportunities. Algorithmic reach in 2026 favors original content and replies over retweets.

**ICE Score: 7/7/7 = 21** (High priority)

**Strategy: Transparent Journey Sharing**

**Content Pillars:**
1. **Revenue milestones**: "$0 -> $100" is compelling content
2. **Technical behind-the-scenes**: "How we use Claude Opus 4.5 for growth strategy"
3. **Lessons learned**: "3 things that didn't work (and 1 that did)"
4. **Product updates**: New features, improvements
5. **User wins**: Anonymized success stories
6. **Hot takes**: Contrarian opinions on growth tactics

**Posting Cadence:**
- 3-5 original posts per day (engagement compounds)
- Mix: 60% value/insights, 25% engagement with others, 15% product
- Use threads for longer content (2-5x engagement vs single tweets)
- Post timing: 8-10am EST, 12-2pm EST, 5-7pm EST

**Quick Start:**
1. Pin tweet with clear CTA to landing page
2. Follow 100 founders in target audience, engage authentically
3. Daily engagement: Reply substantively to 10+ relevant tweets
4. Weekly thread: Deep dive on one topic

**Content Templates:**

```markdown
[MILESTONE THREAD]
Day 30 of building Actionboo.st:

$0 -> $X in revenue
Y paid runs
Z% conversion rate

Here's what I've learned (thread):

1/7 [Lesson about acquisition]

2/7 [Lesson about conversion]

...

7/7 If you want to try it: actionboo.st

What should I share next?
```

```markdown
[CONTRARIAN HOT TAKE]
Hot take: 90% of growth advice is wrong for YOUR business.

"Just do SEO" - wrong if you need revenue this month
"Go viral on TikTok" - wrong if you're B2B
"Build in public" - wrong if your audience isn't on Twitter

The right growth strategy depends on:
- Your stage
- Your audience
- Your constraints

Generic advice is dangerous advice.
```

```markdown
[BEHIND-THE-SCENES POST]
Most AI tools give generic advice.

Here's how Actionboo.st is different:

1. Before generating ANY strategy, we research your competitors
2. We pull actual traffic data (not guesses)
3. We rank tactics by ICE score (Impact, Confidence, Ease)

The result: Advice that's specific to YOUR situation.

Not "try content marketing."

More like "your competitor gets 40% of traffic from YouTube. You have 0 videos. Here's what to make first."

Try it: actionboo.st
```

**Engagement Strategy:**
- Build relationships with 30-50 other founders in your niche
- Host X Spaces on growth topics (collaborative reach)
- Reply with substance, not just "Great post!"
- Quote tweet with added insight > simple retweet

**Expected Results**: 500-2,000 followers in 90 days, warm traffic to site

---

### Channel 4: SEO and Content (MEDIUM-TERM)

**Why it matters**: Zero organic search presence currently. Long-tail keywords like "growth strategy for SaaS founders" have low competition and high intent. Content compounds over time. AI Overviews and Perplexity citations are the new SEO.

**ICE Score: 6/7/5 = 18** (Medium priority - long-term play)

**Strategy: Programmatic + Editorial Mix**

**Phase 1: Editorial Foundation (Month 1)**
1. **Publish this growth plan** as `/blog/our-growth-plan` (demonstrates product quality)
2. **"Growth Roast" series**: Run Actionboo.st on public products, publish analysis
3. **Framework posts**: "The AARRR Framework Explained" with CTA

**Phase 2: Programmatic SEO (Month 2-3)**
1. Use DataForSEO integration to identify 50 long-tail keywords
2. Generate template pages: "Growth Strategy for [Industry/Stage]"
   - "Growth strategy for B2B SaaS"
   - "Growth strategy for marketplace startups"
   - "Growth strategy for indie hackers"
   - "Growth strategy for developer tools"
   - "Growth strategy for AI startups"
3. Each page ends with CTA: "Get a personalized strategy for YOUR startup"

**Phase 3: AI Search Optimization (Ongoing)**
- Optimize for AI answers (Perplexity, ChatGPT search, Google AI Overviews)
- Create content that directly answers common questions
- Structure content with clear headers, bullet points, summaries
- Use structured data (FAQ schema, HowTo schema)
- Include specific numbers and data (AI citations love specificity)

**Target Keywords:**

| Keyword | Monthly Volume | Difficulty | Intent |
|---------|---------------|------------|--------|
| "startup growth strategy" | 1,400 | Medium | High |
| "growth hacking for startups" | 2,600 | Medium | High |
| "how to grow my startup" | 1,100 | Low | High |
| "competitor analysis tool" | 2,000 | High | Medium |
| "AARRR framework" | 900 | Low | High |
| "indie hacker growth" | 500 | Low | Very High |
| "ai growth strategy" | 800 | Low | High |

**Expected Results**: 100-500 organic visitors/month by month 6; compounds thereafter

---

### Channel 5: Short-Form Video (MEDIUM-TERM)

**Why it matters**: 87% of marketers say short-form video is the most effective social media format in 2026. B2B is not exempt -- LinkedIn video posts get 3x engagement vs text. TikTok/Reels reach founders in their "downtime." The algorithm rewards educational content.

**ICE Score: 6/6/5 = 17** (Medium priority)

**Strategy: Educational Hooks**

**Content Ideas (ranked by virality potential):**

| Format | Example | Virality | Production |
|--------|---------|----------|------------|
| Contrarian hook | "3 growth tactics you should STOP doing" | High | Low |
| Case study | "How I'd grow [famous startup] if I started today" | High | Medium |
| Live demo | "I ran an AI growth analysis on [public product]. Here's what it found." | Medium | Medium |
| Quick tip | "The #1 thing stuck founders forget" | Medium | Low |
| Behind scenes | "What happens when you run Actionboo.st" | Medium | Low |

**Platform Priority:**
1. **TikTok**: Discovery engine, younger founders, viral potential
2. **Instagram Reels**: Repurpose TikTok content, broader reach
3. **YouTube Shorts**: SEO benefits, longer shelf life
4. **LinkedIn**: B2B audience, 3x engagement vs text posts

**Production (Solo Developer Optimized):**
- Raw, authentic > polished (builds trust, saves time)
- 30-60 second sweet spot
- Vertical format (9:16)
- Captions mandatory (most watch muted)
- Batch record: 4-5 videos in one session
- Use CapCut or Descript for quick editing

**Content Calendar:**

| Week | Video 1 | Video 2 |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1 | "Stop doing these 3 things" | "The $10 growth strategy" |
| 2 | Demo: Running Actionboo.st | "How I'd grow [Product Hunt top product]" |
| 3 | "AARRR framework in 60 seconds" | "Your competitors know this, you don't" |
| 4 | Results from IH launch | "The real reason you're stuck" |

**Weekly Time Investment: 4 hours**
- 1 hour: Script 4 videos
- 1 hour: Record (batch)
- 2 hours: Edit and post (can be done async)

**Expected Results**: 10-50K views/month possible; 1-5% click-through to site

---

### Channel 6: Newsletter Sponsorships (TEST)

**ICE Score: 5/6/8 = 19** (Test priority - quick to validate)

**Target Newsletters:**

| Newsletter | Audience | Price Range | Fit |
|------------|----------|-------------|-----|
| Indie Hackers digest | Indie hackers | $200-400 | Perfect |
| Failory | Failed/struggling founders | $150-300 | Perfect |
| MicroConf | Bootstrapped SaaS | $300-500 | Great |
| TLDR Founders | Startup founders | $400-800 | Good |
| Lenny's Newsletter | Product/Growth | $1,000+ | Wait |
| Bytes | Dev-focused | $200-400 | Good |

**Test Budget**: $200-500 for first sponsorship

**Approach:**
1. Start with one newsletter closest to target audience (Indie Hackers or Failory)
2. Track with unique promo code (e.g., NEWSLETTER10)
3. Measure CAC; if profitable (< $30 CAC), scale
4. Test different ad copy/CTAs

**Ad Copy Template:**

```markdown
[NEWSLETTER AD]
Stuck on growth? Stop guessing, start knowing.

Actionboo.st researches your competitors' actual traffic sources and gives you a 30-day playbook. What to stop. What to start. What to try this week.

One payment. $9.99. No subscription.

Try it: actionboo.st (code NEWSLETTER10 for 10% off)
```

**Expected Results**: 50-200 clicks, 5-20 conversions at $10-40 CAC

---

### Channel 7: Product Hunt (WAIT)

**Why wait?**: Product Hunt is a one-day spike, not a growth strategy. It requires preparation (hunter network, assets, timing) and results vary wildly. Launch only after establishing community presence.

**ICE Score: 6/5/3 = 14** (Wait - high effort, uncertain results)

**When to launch:**
- After 50+ paid runs (social proof)
- After collecting 5-10 testimonials
- After building Indie Hackers + Reddit presence
- When you can dedicate 24 hours to responding
- Ideally Tuesday/Wednesday (highest traffic)

**Preparation Checklist:**
- [ ] Professional assets (logo, screenshots, video demo)
- [ ] Line up a respected hunter
- [ ] Email list of 200+ for launch-day support
- [ ] Prepare PRODUCTHUNT promo code
- [ ] Have teammates/friends ready to upvote at launch (8am PT)
- [ ] Prepare FAQ for common questions
- [ ] Draft responses to expected comments
- [ ] "Maker comment" story ready

**Expected Results**: 200-1000 visitors, 20-100 conversions, 50-200 email signups

## 4. Activation Optimization

### Current Activation Flow

```
Landing (/)
    |
    v
Hero CTA or "free mini-audit" link
    |
    v
Input Form (/start) - 8 steps, 5-10 minutes
    |
    v
Checkout (coupon or payment or free audit)
    |
    v
Processing (30-90 seconds)
    |
    v
Results (/results/[id] or /free-results/[id])
```

### Time to Value (TTV)

**Current TTV**: ~10 minutes (form) + ~60 seconds (processing) = ~11 minutes to first value

This is acceptable because:
1. Time investment creates psychological commitment (sunk cost)
2. Users who complete the form are highly qualified
3. The form itself provides value (forces strategic thinking)

**Benchmark**: High-performing SaaS companies target TTV under 5 minutes. Actionboo.st's ~11 minutes is acceptable for a high-value output, but the free mini-audit at ~3 minutes is the true first value moment.

### Activation Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Form start rate | 15% of visitors | Interest indicator |
| Form completion rate | 50% of starts | UX quality signal |
| Checkout conversion | 30% of completions | Pricing/value signal |
| Free mini-audit rate | 20% of completions | Lead capture effectiveness |
| Free mini-audit -> paid | 15% | Upsell effectiveness |
| Time to form completion | 5-10 min | Friction indicator |

### Activation Optimizations

**ICE-Scored Improvements:**

| Improvement | Impact | Confidence | Ease | ICE | Priority |
|-------------|--------|------------|------|-----|----------|
| Exit intent mini-audit offer | 7 | 8 | 9 | 24 | **Week 1** |
| Social proof on checkout | 6 | 7 | 9 | 22 | **Week 1** |
| Mobile optimization audit | 7 | 8 | 7 | 22 | **Week 1** |
| Progress save (magic link) | 7 | 6 | 5 | 18 | **Month 1** |
| Loading experience upgrade | 5 | 7 | 6 | 18 | **Month 1** |
| Post-purchase onboarding email | 6 | 7 | 7 | 20 | **Week 2** |
| A/B test CTA copy | 5 | 5 | 8 | 18 | **Month 1** |

**Week 1-2 Quick Wins:**

1. **Exit intent on form** - If user tries to leave, offer free mini-audit as capture mechanism
   - "Not ready to commit? Get a free mini-audit to see what we can find."
   - Implementation: Add exit intent listener, show modal

2. **Social proof on checkout** - Add dynamic counter
   - "X founders used Actionboo.st this week"
   - Pull from database, update daily

3. **Mobile optimization** - Audit and fix any mobile issues
   - Form should work smoothly on mobile (40%+ of traffic)
   - Test on multiple device sizes

4. **Post-purchase onboarding email** - Send 24 hours after purchase
   - "Here's how to get the most from your strategy"
   - Link to results
   - Tease subscription waitlist

**Month 1 Improvements:**

5. **Save progress** - Allow users to save form and return via email magic link
   - Reduces abandonment for users who get interrupted
   - Send reminder email after 24 hours

6. **Loading experience** - Turn processing wait into engagement opportunity
   - Show what's happening: "Researching competitors..." "Analyzing traffic data..." "Building your roadmap..."
   - Preview sections as they complete

### Free Mini-Audit Optimization

The free mini-audit is the primary lead capture mechanism.

**Current Flow:**
```
Checkout -> "Just want a taste?" -> Free mini-audit
```

**Optimized Flow:**
```
Landing -> "Free mini-audit" CTA (secondary) -> Captures email
                    |
                    v
            Delivers value (3 sections)
                    |
                    v
            Upsell to full $9.99 version
                    |
                    v
            Email follow-up sequence
```

**Upsell Triggers:**
- End of mini-audit: "Your full strategy has 7 more sections. Get them for $9.99."
- Email 24 hours later: "Did you implement anything from your mini-audit? Get the full playbook."
- Email 7 days later: "Still stuck? Your competitors haven't stopped. Get your full strategy."

**Expected free -> paid conversion**: 15% (industry benchmark for freemium is 12%)

## 5. Retention Strategies

### Current State

- RAG integration remembers returning users
- Claude builds on past advice for repeat customers
- Dashboard shows past runs
- Magic link auth for frictionless return
- AARRR focus selector enables multi-run value

### Retention Hooks

**1. Multi-Focus Returns**

User does acquisition run first, returns for monetization focus later. Each AARRR focus area is a new reason to come back.

**Communication strategy:**
- 7 days after first run: "How's acquisition going? Ready to focus on activation?"
- 30 days after run: "Your competitors' data is 30 days old. Want a refresh?"
- 60 days: "It's been 2 months. What's changed? Let's update your strategy."

**2. Progress Tracking (Light Touch)**

Email sequence post-purchase:

| Day | Email | Subject | CTA |
|-----|-------|---------|-----|
| 0 | Receipt | "Your Actionboo.st strategy is ready" | View results |
| 7 | Check-in | "How's week 1 going?" | Reply for help |
| 30 | Refresh prompt | "Your competitive data is 30 days old" | Get refresh |
| 60 | Re-engagement | "What's changed? Let's update your strategy" | New run |

**3. Results Expiration Nudge**
- "Your results remain accessible, but your competitive data is now 30 days old."
- CTA: "Get a refresh for $9.99"

**4. Subscription Waitlist**
- After positive experience, offer: "Want this analysis every week, automatically?"
- Collect email for v2 subscription launch
- Early access = 50% off first 3 months

### Repeat Purchase Optimization

**Goal**: 15% of users purchase again within 90 days

**Tactics:**
1. Different focus areas (acquisition -> retention -> monetization)
2. "Refresh" positioning (competitive data gets stale)
3. Credit toward subscription for repeat purchasers
4. Loyalty discount: 10% off second run

---

## 6. Referral Mechanics

### The Referral Equation

```
Viral Coefficient (K) = Invites Sent x Conversion Rate
```

**Target**: K > 0.15 (each 7 users bring 1 new user)

**Industry context**: A K-Factor of 0.2-0.7 still compounds meaningfully when paired with steady activation and retention. For B2B SaaS tools, K of 0.15-0.3 is realistic and valuable.

### Referral Program Design

**Model**: "Give $3, Get $3" (Two-Sided Incentive)
- Double-sided incentives increase conversion rates by up to 3x
- When you refer a friend who completes a paid run:
  - They get $3 off ($6.99 instead of $9.99)
  - You get $3 credit toward your next run

**Why $3 not "free":**
- Keeps unit economics healthy ($6.99 - $0.50 cost = $6.49 margin)
- Creates urgency (credit expires in 90 days)
- $3 off is meaningful for a $9.99 purchase (30% discount)

### Implementation

1. **After results page, prompt:**
   > "Know a founder who's stuck? Share your referral link. They save $3, you earn $3 credit."

2. **Generate unique referral link** per user
   - Format: `actionboo.st/?ref=[code]`
   - Code tied to user email

3. **Track referral chain** in database
   - Add to runs table or create referrals view

4. **Auto-credit both parties** when referred user pays

### Alternative: Share-Worthy Outputs

Make the output itself shareable (zero-cost referral):

1. **"Share your strategy" button** on results page
   - Generates public link: `/share/[slug]`
   - Selective sharing (Executive Summary only, or full strategy)

2. **Screenshot-optimized sections**
   - Executive Summary designed to look good as screenshot
   - "Quick Wins" section as shareable image
   - Growth Flywheel diagram is highly shareable

3. **Twitter/X share buttons**
   - Pre-populated tweet: "Just got my growth strategy from @actionboost. Key insight: [auto-pull excerpt]"

4. **Open Graph optimization**
   - Share links show preview of Executive Summary
   - Custom OG image with growth flywheel

### Referral Timing

Best times to prompt sharing:
1. **Immediately after results** - Peak satisfaction moment
2. **Post-quick-win implementation** - When they see results
3. **30-day follow-up email** - "How's it going? Share with a fellow founder"

**Expected Results**: 10-20% of users share; 5-10% of shares convert; K = 0.05-0.15

## 7. Monetization Path

### Current: One-Shot Model

| Product | Price | Cost | Margin |
|---------|-------|------|--------|
| Full strategy | $9.99 | ~$0.50 | 95% |
| Free mini-audit | $0 | ~$0.04 | N/A (lead gen) |

### The Flywheel: One-Shot to Subscription

```
[Free Mini-Audit] - Captures email, shows value
        |
        v
[One-Shot $9.99] - Proves quality, builds trust
        |
        v
[v2 Subscription ~$29/mo] - Recurring revenue, true business
        |
        v
[Connected Analytics] - Deep value, high retention
```

### v2 Vision: The Growth Board

**What is it?**
Your strategy becomes a living dashboard:
- Track what you tried
- Report outcomes
- AI adapts recommendations based on results
- Weekly digest email with fresh competitive insights
- Connect analytics (PostHog, GA, Mixpanel) for automatic analysis
- Reply to weekly email to ask questions

**Why it works:**
- One-shot is a transaction; subscription is a relationship
- Every $9.99 customer is a potential $360/year subscriber
- Founders want accountability, not just advice
- Connected analytics create switching cost

**Pricing:**

| Plan | Price | Includes |
|------|-------|----------|
| Growth Board | $29/mo | 2 full analyses/month, weekly digest, email support |
| Growth Board Pro | $49/mo | Unlimited analyses, connected analytics, priority support |

**Unit Economics (v2):**

| Metric | Growth Board | Growth Board Pro |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| Monthly revenue | $29 | $49 |
| Monthly cost | ~$2 | ~$5 |
| Margin | 93% | 90% |
| LTV (6-month retention) | $174 | $294 |

### Upsell Triggers (One-Shot to Subscription)

1. **Post-purchase email** (immediate):
   > "Want this analysis every week, automatically? Join the waitlist for Growth Board."

2. **Results page CTA** (bottom of page):
   > "Turn this into a living growth board. Get weekly updates. $29/mo."

3. **30-day follow-up** (email):
   > "Ready to track your progress? The Growth Board is coming. Founding members get 50% off the first 3 months."

4. **Credit window** (conversion optimization):
   - Subscribe within 7 days of one-shot purchase
   - Get $9.99 credited to first month
   - Removes "I just paid" objection

### Pricing Psychology

**Why $9.99 works:**
- Below $10 psychological threshold
- No approval needed (vs enterprise purchases)
- Low enough to impulse buy after form completion
- High enough to signal quality (not free/low-value)

**Why not higher?**
- Target audience is bootstrapped/cash-conscious
- Goal is volume + conversion to subscription
- $9.99 x 1000 users + 10% subscribe = $9,990 + $2,900/mo recurring

4. **Referral tracking**: Automate credit issuance via webhook

### Sustainability

This is a marathon, not a sprint:
- Cap promotional work at 1.5 hours/day

- Batch similar tasks (all video recording in one session)
- Don't chase every channel - focus on 2-3 that work
- Celebrate small wins (every 10 paid runs)

---

## 12. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| IH/Reddit launch flops | Medium | Medium | Don't rely on single launch; consistent presence matters more |
| Negative public feedback | Low | High | Respond graciously, iterate quickly, offer refunds |
| ChatGPT adds research features | Medium | High | Double down on specialization + structured output quality |
| Burnout from manual promotion | High | Medium | Cap daily promo at 1.5 hours; batch and automate |
| Low conversion rate | Medium | High | A/B test landing page; add testimonials quickly |
| Competitor copies positioning | Medium | Low | First-mover advantage; community trust is defensible |
| API costs increase | Low | Medium | Monitor usage; have fallback to Sonnet for lower tiers |
| Reddit account banned | Medium | Medium | Follow 90/10 rule strictly; don't create backup (against TOS) |
| Form abandonment too high | Medium | Medium | Add save progress, exit intent capture |

### Contingency Plans

**If organic channels don't work (Month 2):**
- Increase newsletter sponsorship budget to $500/mo
- Test small Meta ads budget ($200)
- Double down on SEO/content for long-term

**If conversion rate < 1%:**
- Run user interviews (offer free runs for feedback)
- A/B test pricing ($7.99 vs $9.99 vs $12.99)
- Simplify form (reduce steps)
- Add more social proof

**If free -> paid < 5%:**
- Improve mini-audit quality (more sections)
- Test different upsell messaging
- Add scarcity/urgency to upsell
- Personalize follow-up emails

  COUNT(runs.id) as conversions,
  SUM(CASE WHEN runs.status = 'complete' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed
