# Indie Hackers Posts - Edited Versions

## Post 1 — Jan 20: "Launch day. It went about how you'd expect."

Submitted Boost to PeerPush ($25) and Uneed ($15). Posted to r/sideprojects. Got -3 votes and nothing but spam DMs. Classic Reddit.

Then I found a feature flag bug that was blocking checkout for actual paying users. The kind of bug you only find when someone tries to give you money. Spent the evening fixing that instead of celebrating.

Also learned that fire-and-forget serverless functions on Vercel just... don't work the way I needed. The function was dying mid-run. Two real users got stuck with broken results. Had to manually patch their data.

Total marketing spend so far: $40. Total things that went wrong on day one: lost count.

The product works though. When it doesn't crash. Shipping tomorrow's fixes tonight.

## Post 2 — Jan 24: "Won App of the Week. Also threw out my entire target audience."

Good news first: Boost hit #1 App of the Week on PeerPush.

Then I looked at who was actually interested and realized I'd been targeting the wrong people. I built this thinking SMBs — salons, local services, that kind of thing. Turns out those people are nearly impossible to reach online. Enji.co has a team of 12, has been at it for 4+ years, and gets about 1.5K monthly visits. That math doesn't work for a solo dev.

Pivoted to tech-adjacent founders. SaaS builders, e-commerce operators, consultants. People who are already online and already know they need marketing help.

Rewrote the brand voice too. Dropped the warm hand-holding tone for something more direct. "Here's what to do" instead of "let's figure it out together."

Also rebuilt the core pipeline. The AI now decides what to research dynamically instead of me pre-defining every step. Early feedback said the output was too much text. Working on that.

## Post 3 — Jan 28: "Built a free tool. Reddit is weird. Both are working."

Made a free marketing audit at aboo.st/tools/marketing-audit — enter your URL, get a diagnostic of whether a stranger can understand what you do in 3 seconds. It uses Tavily for web scraping, captures a screenshot, and runs GPT-4.1-mini vision to actually look at the page like a human would. Costs me about $0.04 per audit.

Started a Reddit growth loop alongside it. Not spamming links. Actually helping people in marketing and entrepreneur subs with real advice, mentioning Boost when it's genuinely relevant. Helped a tall women's fashion brand figure out their positioning. Gave a Florence walking tour operator specific channel advice.

The interesting Reddit data: posts get almost no upvotes but 26 saves on one thread. People bookmark useful stuff. They just don't clap for it. Engagement metrics lie — saves tell the real story.

Also shipped 5 SEO comparison pages, added structured data, and built an llms.txt file so AI search tools can find Boost.

## Post 4 — Jan 30: "Day 10. Here's where things actually stand."

Ten days in. $40 spent. The most important thing I shipped wasn't code.

My original pitch leaned on "competitive intelligence" and "market research." Nobody cared. Turns out my ICP isn't people who want research. It's founders who have a product but haven't figured out acquisition yet. They don't know what to do for marketing. They're guessing.

"Competitor research" was leading with the engine. The destination is: "You'll know exactly what to do for the next 30 days."

Rewrote the positioning around that today. The product is a 30-day marketing plan built on real research about your market, competitors, and audience. $29, one-time. No subscription.

Next up: more free tools — target audience generator, headline analyzer. Keep the Reddit loop going. Testing if positioning clarity drives conversion better than volume.
