## Om's Growth Playbook (from Reddit post)

### 1. Hunt Pain in Heated Debates
- Find low-upvote posts with 400+ comments
- Arguments expose genuine pain = people will pay

### 2. Track Spending Signals
- Don't ask "would you pay" — find people already spending
- Founders paying $300/mo for research platforms = clear signal

### 3. Add Value First, Sell Second
- Join 5-6 founder communities
- Help genuinely for 1-2 weeks
- Then DM directly when relevant pain appears

### 4. Price from Day One
- $39/mo minimum filters for serious customers
- Payment creates commitment

### 5. Target Community Influencers
- One testimonial in right Slack > 200 cold emails
- Sponsor small, focused newsletters

### 6. Counter-Intuitive Insights
- Competition validates market (don't fear it)
- Good customers hesitate at price (if they don't, you're underpriced)
- Building in public = B2C. B2B cares about outcomes.

## Pricing Insight: $39 Filters for Serious Customers

> "Founders who can't spend $39 aren't serious customers. Payment creates commitment - they'll actually use your product and give honest feedback and get back to you, not just cancel and throw you away like trash while you sit and think what you did wrong."

**The principle:** Higher price = commitment filter. Serious founders:
- Actually use the product
- Give honest feedback
- Don't ghost you

**Question for Boost:**
- Is $9.99 too low? Are we attracting tire-kickers?
- $9.99 → $29-39 would 3-4x revenue per customer AND filter for seriousness
- v2 subscription is planned at $29/mo — maybe one-shot should be closer to that?

**Counter-argument:**
- $9.99 is impulse-buy territory (low friction)
- Our flywheel: $9.99 one-shot → love it → $29/mo subscription
- Different model than BigIdeasDB's database access

**Worth testing:** A/B test $9.99 vs $29 one-shot. Track:
- Conversion rate
- Refinement usage (engagement proxy)
- Support requests / feedback quality
- Subscription upsell rate
