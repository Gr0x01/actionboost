## Tool Ideas for Boost

### Tier 0: SHIPPED
1. **Marketing Audit** (`/tools/marketing-audit`) — "The 3-Second Test." Enter URL → get diagnostic findings + fixes. ~$0.02/use (Tavily + GPT-4.1-mini). Funnels to $29 Boost.

### Tier 0.5: Next Up (Viral Potential)
1. **Roast My Site** — Same pipeline as Marketing Audit but with a brutally honest, roast-comedy voice. Users share the roast. Viral loop: funny roasts get screenshotted → shared on Twitter/Reddit → drives traffic. Same CTA: "Want the actual fix? Get your Boost." Could reuse 90% of the audit infrastructure with a different GPT prompt.

### Tier 1: Directly Showcases Boost's Value
1. **Channel Fit Calculator** — Quick quiz → channel priority ranking. Target: "marketing channel calculator"
2. **Marketing Strategy Analyzer** — Paste strategy → gap analysis. Target: "marketing strategy analyzer"
3. **Competitor Positioning Quiz** — "Where do you fit?" → positioning recs

### Tier 2: Standalone High-Traffic
4. **SaaS Pricing Calculator** — Usage/seat/hybrid estimator (2-5K/month searches)
5. **CAC Calculator** — Spend ÷ customers with benchmarks (1-3K/month)
6. **Product-Market Fit Quiz** — Scored assessment (500-1K/month)
7. **Marketing Budget Allocator** — Budget → channel splits (1-2K/month)

### Tier 3: Volume Play (Lower Lift)
8. **ICP Generator** — Quick form → ICP template (2-5K/month)
9. **Positioning Statement Generator** — Mad-lib inputs → statement (1-2K/month)
10. **Value Proposition Generator** — Problem/solution → value prop (2-4K/month)
11. **Marketing Plan Template Generator** — Fill basics → 1-page plan (3-8K/month)

## Implementation Plan

**Phase 1**: Build 1 high-impact tool (Tier 1). No email gate. Instant results. "Want the full 30-day plan?" CTA.

**Phase 2**: Add 3-5 calculators. Cross-link. Educational content below each. "Free Tools" section in footer.

**Phase 3**: Template generators for top-of-funnel volume.

## Critical Decisions

- **No email gate** for first tools (maximize usage/virality/backlinks)
- **Quality over quantity** — 1 great tool first, then expand
- **Teaser approach** — tools show Boost's thinking methodology as preview

## Metrics to Track

- Organic traffic per tool page
- Tool usage rate (use vs bounce)
- Backlinks earned
- Tool users → paid conversions
- Keyword rankings for target terms
