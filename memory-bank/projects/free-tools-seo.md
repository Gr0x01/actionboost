Differentiator: they're generic AI output. We use **live research data** (Tavily, DataForSEO, screenshots).

## Tool Ideas for Boost — Prioritized Build Order

### SHIPPED
1. **Marketing Audit** (`/tools/marketing-audit`) — "The 3-Second Test." Enter URL → diagnostic findings + fixes. ~$0.04-0.06/use. Funnels to $29 Boost.

### Phase 1: Build Next (highest ROI, simplest, Jan 2026)

| # | Tool | Target Keywords | Volume | Cost/Use | Funnel | Complexity |
|---|------|----------------|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| 1 | **Target Audience Generator** ✅ SHIPPED | "target audience generator", "find my target audience", "how to find target audience" | MEDIUM-HIGH (5-10K/mo + long-tail) | $0.03-0.05 | "Now you know WHO. Get the HOW for $29" | Simple |
| 2 | **Headline / Value Prop Analyzer** | "headline analyzer", "value proposition generator" | HIGH (20-40K/mo) | $0.02-0.04 | "Score 62/100. See how competitors do it? $29" | Simple |
| 3 | **Email Subject Line Scorer** | "email subject line tester" | HIGH (15-25K/mo) | $0.01-0.02 | "Get a complete email strategy in your plan. $29" | Simple |

**Keyword strategy for Target Audience Generator:**
- Named "Target Audience Generator" NOT "ICP Generator" — "target audience" is what real people search, "ICP" is B2B SaaS jargon (1-3K/mo)
- "buyer persona generator" owned by HubSpot, "user persona generator" owned by FounderPal — avoid both
- Page title: "Free Target Audience Generator — Find Your Ideal Customer in Minutes"
- Secondary keywords woven into FAQ/body: "customer persona", "define target market", "who is my ideal customer", "customer avatar"
- **Programmatic SEO**: Pre-generate 100+ example pages at `/tools/target-audience-generator/examples/[niche]` (e.g., yoga-studio, shopify-store, saas-startup). Each captures long-tail "target audience for [niche]" queries. FounderPal does this exact play with `/user-persona-examples/[industry]`.

### Phase 2: Leverage Existing Infra

| # | Tool | Target Keywords | Volume | Cost/Use | Funnel | Complexity |
|---|------|----------------|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| 4 | **Landing Page Copy Roast** | "landing page analyzer", "website copy review" | MEDIUM (5-10K/mo) | $0.05-0.08 | "Found 7 copy issues. Get full messaging strategy. $29" | Simple (reuses screenshot) |
| 5 | **Competitor Finder** | "competitor analysis tool free", "find my competitors" | HIGH (15-30K/mo) | $0.08-0.12 | "Here are 5 competitors. Know how to beat them? $29" | Medium (reuses Tavily) |

### Phase 3: Expand Reach

| # | Tool | Target Keywords | Volume | Cost/Use | Funnel | Complexity |
|---|------|----------------|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| 6 | **Content Idea Generator** | "content ideas generator", "what to post on LinkedIn" | HIGH (30K+/mo) | $0.02-0.04 | "10 ideas for this week. Full content strategy? $29" | Simple |
| 7 | **Marketing Channel Recommender** | "best marketing channels", "marketing plan generator" | HIGH (20-40K/mo) | $0.03-0.05 | "Top 3 channels. 30-day execution plan? $29" | Simple |
| 8 | **AI Visibility / AEO Grader** | "AI search optimization", "AI visibility checker" | MED-HIGH (emerging) | $0.05-0.08 | "Low AI visibility. Full AI-era SEO strategy? $29" | Medium |

### Volume Play (Later)
- Slogan/Tagline Generator (20-30K/mo, $0.01, weak funnel but high volume)
- Pricing Page Analyzer (5-10K/mo, $0.04-0.07, reuses screenshot)
- SaaS Pricing Calculator, CAC Calculator, PMF Quiz
- Positioning Statement Generator, Value Prop Generator, Marketing Plan Template

## Implementation Plan

**Phase 1** (now): Build 3 simple text-in/score-out tools. No email gate. Instant results. Shared `/tools/[slug]` pattern.

**Phase 2**: Leverage screenshot service + Tavily for richer tools. Cross-link between tools.

**Phase 3**: Volume play — more generators, calculators. "Free Tools" hub page. Educational content below each tool (500-1000 words).

## Critical Decisions

- **No email gate** for first tools (maximize usage/virality/backlinks)
- **Quality over quantity** — 1 great tool first, then expand
- **Teaser approach** — tools show Boost's thinking methodology as preview

## Metrics to Track

- Organic traffic per tool page
- Tool usage rate (use vs bounce)
- Backlinks earned
- Tool users → paid conversions
- Keyword rankings for target terms
