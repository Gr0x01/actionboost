# Product: Boost

## Value Prop

> "Tell us about your business. We'll tell you what's actually going on — and exactly what to do about it. $29."

You describe your business. We research your market from hundreds of sources across the internet and tell you: what's working, what's not, what to stop, what to start, and what to do this week.

**Framing rule**: The output includes a week-by-week roadmap, but lead with the diagnosis and direction — not the plan format. "30-day plan" sounds like homework. "Here's what's going on and what to do next" sounds like relief.

---

## External Messaging Rules (MANDATORY for all customer-facing copy)

These rules govern how Boost is described in Reddit comments, landing pages, emails, social posts, and any outward-facing text. They override any feature-level details elsewhere in this doc.

### The Hierarchy: Outcome > Problem > Mechanism

When describing Boost externally, always follow this order:

1. **Outcome** (what changes for them): "You'll know exactly what to do next with your marketing."
2. **Problem** (what they feel now): "Instead of guessing, trying random tactics, or paying an agency thousands."
3. **Mechanism** (how, briefly, only if needed): "We research your actual market and give you a clear plan."

Never lead with mechanism. Never lead with features.

### Language Rules

**ALWAYS frame as:**
- What changes for the customer (they get clarity, they stop guessing, they know what to do)
- The feeling of relief (finally knowing, not wondering anymore)
- The contrast with alternatives (vs. guessing, vs. generic ChatGPT advice, vs. $5K agencies)

**NEVER frame as:**
- A list of what the product does (researches competitors, analyzes keywords, generates content)
- "Competitive research" or "competitive analysis" as a headline or lead
- The output format (10 sections, 30-day roadmap, AARRR framework)
- The tools or data sources (Tavily, DataForSEO, Opus)
- A "marketing plan" (tested poorly, sounds like homework)

### Describing What Boost Does (approved patterns)

Use these patterns when someone asks "what is Boost?":

| Instead of this (feature/mechanism) | Say this (outcome/benefit) |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| "It does competitive research on your market" | "It tells you what's actually going on with your marketing" |
| "It analyzes hundreds of sources" | "It looks at your real market — not templates" |
| "It generates a 30-day marketing plan" | "It tells you exactly what to do this week" |
| "It includes competitor analysis" | "You'll see what's working for others in your space" |
| "It uses real SEO data and web research" | "It's based on your actual market, not generic advice" |
| "We research your competitors" | "You'll finally know where you stand" |

### The One-Sentence Test

Every external description of Boost should pass this test: **Does it describe what changes for the customer, or what the product does?**

- FAIL: "Boost researches your market from hundreds of sources and delivers a competitive analysis with a 30-day action plan."
- PASS: "Boost tells you what's actually going on with your marketing — and exactly what to do about it."
- PASS: "Stop guessing. For $29, you'll know what's working, what's not, and what to do this week."

### Reddit/Social Comment Patterns

When mentioning Boost in comments (help-first, not pitching):

- "I ran [their business type] through Boost and here's what came back..." (share the insight, not the product features)
- "The biggest thing was finding out that [specific finding]. Turns out [insight]." (lead with the value of clarity)
- Never: "Boost does competitive research using real data sources to create a marketing plan for your business."

## ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

### The Person

A solo founder past the building phase who has a working product or service but no reliable way to get customers. Revenue is zero to low. Marketing efforts have been sporadic and directionless. They are one clear plan away from momentum — they just don't know what that plan is.

**Stage**: Post-product, pre-traction. They've built something that works. They haven't figured out acquisition.

**Tech comfort**: Tech-adjacent — can find and buy tools online, but won't build their own.

### Their Internal Monologue

- "I have a good product but nobody knows about it"
- "I keep doing random marketing stuff and nothing works"
- "I don't even know where to start"
- "Should I be on Twitter? TikTok? SEO? Cold email? All of it?"
- "I can't afford an agency and ChatGPT gives me generic garbage"

### Trigger Moments (What Makes Them Search)

- Just launched and got zero signups
- Hit a revenue plateau and random tactics stopped working
- Saw a competitor doing better and panicked
- Wasted money on ads or an agency that did nothing
- Got rejected from an accelerator and told "figure out your GTM"

### Who This Is NOT For

- Funded startups with a marketing team (they need execution, not a plan)
- People without a product yet (they need to build first)
- People wanting ongoing marketing management (this is a one-shot catalyst)
- Pure indie hackers who'd rather build it themselves

### Targeting Segments (Channels, Not ICP)

Business type determines where we reach them, not who they are:

1. **SaaS founders / solopreneurs** — r/SaaS, r/solopreneur, Twitter/X, Indie Hackers
2. **E-commerce / Shopify** — r/ecommerce, r/shopify
3. **Service businesses** — consultants, freelancers who find us (self-selecting)

**Why these segments (Jan 24 2026 pivot):**
- SMBs (salons, local services) are hard to reach — Enji.co tried 4+ years with 12 people, still only 1.5K monthly visits
- SaaS/solopreneur subreddits are FULL of marketing questions — proven demand
- These audiences can actually FIND tools online (unlike traditional SMBs)
- **Founder personality fit**: Blunt, direct, helpful — matches this audience

### Messaging Hierarchy (Promise > Proof > Mechanism)

1. **Promise**: You'll finally know what's going on with your marketing — and exactly what to do about it
2. **Proof**: Based on real research into your actual market — not templates, not vibes, not generic AI advice
3. **Mechanism** (only when asked): We look at your business, your market, and what's working for others in your space, then tell you what to stop, start, and do next

### Competitive Alternatives (Dunford Positioning)

**What would customers do without us?** (ranked by frequency)
1. Wing it — keep doing random stuff and hoping (THE real competitor: inertia)
2. Google it — DIY research, overwhelming, no structure
3. Ask ChatGPT — generic advice, not tailored to their market
4. Ask a friend — limited to their experience
5. Hire an agency — $2K-10K/month, overkill for this stage

**Our differentiation:** You'll know exactly what's going on and what to do next — based on your real market, not generic advice. For $29, not $5,000.

## Brand Voice

### Core Narrative

**"Stop guessing. Get clarity on what's working and what's not."**

The action-first, research-backed strategist who tells you exactly what to do. Specific recommendations, no fluff.

### The Personality

**Boost = the direct strategist who respects your intelligence.** Blunt, practical, tells you exactly what to do.

**5 traits:**
1. **Direct** — gets to the point, respects your time
2. **Practical** — focused on what you can actually do this week
3. **Action-first** — leads with what to do, backs it with research
4. **Honest** — tells you what's working AND what's not (even if it stings)
5. **Helpful** — genuinely wants you to succeed, not just sell you something

### Voice Guidelines

| We sound like | We don't sound like |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Smart peer who cuts through the noise | Startup bro |
| Direct strategist with receipts | LinkedIn influencer |
| "Here's exactly what to do" | "It depends..." |
| Confident, helpful | Condescending, preachy |

**Words we use:** plan, specific, your business, this week, here's what, stop, start, data, competitors, exactly

**Words we avoid:** leverage, optimize, scale, transform, journey, solution, cutting-edge, empower, unlock, hack, growth hacking, "let's figure it out together" (too hand-holdy)

### Copy Patterns (Jan 2026)

| Element | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Headlines | Direct, confident | "Finally know what's working — and what to do next." |
| Subheads | Specific, outcome-focused | "Real research. Clear diagnosis. Exactly what to do." |
| CTAs | Action-oriented | "Get Your Boost", "Show me what's wrong", "Tell me what to do" |
| Guarantees | Clear, near CTA | "Money back if it doesn't help. Seriously." |
| Trust | Specific audiences | "SaaS, e-commerce, consultants" |
| Labels | Sentence case, clean | "Your marketing plans" not "YOUR ACTION PLANS" |

### Copy Rules

1. **Lead with the problem** — They know they're stuck, get to the solution
2. **Be specific over vague** — "See where competitors get their traffic" not "understand your competitive landscape"
3. **Use active voice** — "We research your competitors" not "Competitor analysis is performed"
4. **Respect their intelligence** — They know marketing matters, don't over-explain
5. **Industry terms are fine** — This audience knows AARRR, CAC, etc. (but still avoid jargon for jargon's sake)
6. **Price + guarantee together** — Removes risk, makes decision easy
7. **Use sentence case** — Clean, not shouty
8. **Sound confident** — "Here's what to do" not "Here's what you might consider"
9. **Show the outcome** — "A plan you can start tomorrow" not "Comprehensive strategy document"
10. **Be direct** — "Stop doing X" not "You might want to reconsider X"

### What NOT to do

- Don't mention what AI model powers it (irrelevant to outcome)
- Don't use ALL CAPS labels (shouty)
- Don't over-explain basics (this audience gets it)
- Don't use exclamation points (tryhard energy)
- Don't hedge ("might" "could" "potentially") — commit to what we deliver
- Don't use emojis
- Don't sound like a startup bro ("crush it", "10x", "hack")
- Don't be warm/hand-holdy ("let's figure it out together", "don't worry")
- Don't be preachy or condescending
