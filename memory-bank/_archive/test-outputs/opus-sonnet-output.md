## Your Situation

**Positioning Assessment**

Your positioning is **clear and compelling**. "Shazam for tattoos" is a near-perfect analogy—it instantly communicates the core value proposition to anyone who's used music recognition apps. You've identified a genuine market gap: Instagram is where tattoo artists live, but it's architecturally hostile to discovery. You can't search by style, location, or visual similarity. Google is marginally better but relies on artists self-optimizing for SEO (most don't). You're building the search layer that should exist but doesn't.

The positioning sharpens further when you consider the alternatives. "Ask a friend" is limited to their network's taste. "Google it" surfaces whoever bothered with SEO, not necessarily the best artists. "Wing it" is how people end up with regret tattoos. You're not competing with Instagram—you're filling a gap Instagram created.

**Verdict: Clear.** Strong differentiation via visual search technology, obvious target (people who care about finding the *right* artist), and a value prop that's immediately understood. The "Shazam for tattoos" framing does heavy lifting.

**What Makes You Different**

You're the only platform where someone can upload a reference image and find artists whose actual portfolio work matches that style—not just artists who claim to do that style. CLIP embeddings on 200,000 images is a technical moat competitors can't easily replicate.

**Who You Serve Best**

Design-conscious first-time or infrequent tattoo clients who have a clear visual reference but don't know how to find an artist who can execute it. These people will spend hours researching before committing to permanent body art.

## Key Discoveries

### Discovery 1: No research data was provided to analyze

Your request included a "Research Data" section that was empty. Without Reddit threads, competitor analysis, keyword data, or scraped market intelligence, I can't surface the kind of specific, sourced discoveries that would make this preview valuable.

*Source: N/A*

**Why it matters:** The preview's value comes from showing you things you couldn't find yourself. With research data, I could tell you things like which Reddit communities are actively searching for artist discovery solutions, what specific complaints people have about existing methods, or which competitor gaps you could exploit. Without it, I'm limited to analyzing what you've already told me.

**To complete this preview properly:** Share the research data (Reddit posts, competitor sites, keyword tools, forum discussions, etc.) and I'll find the surprising, specific discoveries that demonstrate real strategic value.
