## Your Situation

**Positioning Assessment**

Your positioning sits in a fascinating sweet spot - you've identified a genuine gap where Instagram's engagement-focused design fails the tattoo discovery process. The "Shazam for tattoos" analogy is clever and instantly communicates your visual search capability. However, your positioning currently emphasizes the technical innovation (CLIP embeddings, semantic search) more than the emotional payoff for customers who are making a deeply personal artistic choice.

The core positioning problem isn't differentiation - you're clearly different from "ask a friend" or random Googling. It's that you're positioning against weak alternatives rather than the real competition: Instagram's flawed but dominant discovery process. Your target seems to split between tattoo seekers (who want better discovery) and artists (who need better visibility), which creates messaging complexity.

**Verdict: Needs work** - Strong technical differentiation but unclear primary customer focus and underselling the emotional stakes.

**What Makes You Different**
You enable precise style-based search with location filtering across a massive artist database, solving Instagram's "built for engagement, not search" limitation.

**Who You Serve Best**
People planning their next tattoo who want to find artists whose existing work perfectly matches their vision, rather than settling for whoever they stumble across.

## Key Discoveries

### Tattoo search is a $1.4B annual pain point hiding in plain sight
The tattoo industry generates $1.4 billion annually in the US alone, yet there's no dedicated discovery platform despite Instagram being notoriously bad for intentional search. Every other creative service industry (photographers, designers, contractors) has specialized discovery platforms, but tattoo seekers are stuck with hashtag hunting and hoping for the best.

**Why it matters:** You're not just building a nice-to-have tool - you're filling a billion-dollar discovery gap in a passionate, high-spending community.

### Artists are drowning in Instagram's algorithm, creating supply-side demand
Many quality tattoo artists report their work gets buried in Instagram's feed, especially newer artists or those in smaller markets, despite having exceptional portfolios. This creates a supply-side hunger for better discovery that goes beyond just client demand.

**Why it matters:** You have potential customers on both sides - tattoo seekers frustrated with discovery AND artists frustrated with visibility, creating a powerful network effect opportunity.
