## r/smallbusiness — Florence walking tours (arsaldotchd)

Your biggest problem isn't visibility — it's that you're invisible to people who are already in Florence looking for exactly what you offer. Here's what I'd focus on:

**1. Get on Viator immediately.** It does 8.7M visits/month. Tourists searching "Florence walking tour" are booking there, not on Google. Optimize your listing title for what makes you different — something like "Florence Walking Tour — Recommended by Locals, Led by a Licensed Guide." Most competitors position as generic "local guides." None of them lead with "recommended by Florentines," which is your actual differentiator.

**2. Google Business Profile — claim it and fully optimize it.** Photos, services, pricing, tour descriptions. When someone Googles "walking tour Florence" from their phone while standing near the Duomo, you need to show up in the map pack. This is free and it's how last-minute mobile bookers find tours.

**3. Build a review engine.** TripAdvisor's algorithm weights recency heavily — a competitor with 500 reviews from 2022 ranks lower than one with 100 reviews from the last 3 months. At the end of every tour, hand out a card with a QR code linking to your TripAdvisor page. Follow up with a short email the next day. Make it systematic, not optional.

**4. Hotel concierge partnerships.** You said locals love your tours — formalize that. Walk into 10 boutique hotels near the historic center with a one-page proposal: they recommend you to guests, you give them a 15% commission or a free tour for their staff. Reddit travel forums are full of people saying "the hotel recommended a great tour." That's a channel you can own.

The booking platforms (Viator, GetYourGuide, Airbnb Experiences) take a cut, but they put you in front of millions of tourists who are already searching. You can always drive direct bookings later once you have reviews and visibility. Right now you need to be where the tourists are already looking.

## r/SaaS — Sales Question follow-up (Icy_Sheepherder_9444)

That's exactly what happens when you do it right. You're not convincing them — you're describing their problem so accurately that they convince themselves.

Think about it from their side. Some stranger walks up and says "Hey, I built a thing that does X, want to try it?" That's a pitch. Their guard goes up.

But if you ask "What's the most annoying part of [workflow]?" and they vent for 3 minutes, and then you say "Yeah — that's exactly what I'm working on solving. Would it help if [specific thing your product does]?" — that's not a pitch. That's a conversation where they just told you they have the problem and you're offering to fix it.

The "hang on a minute" moment happens naturally when you've correctly identified their pain. You don't need to manufacture it.

For the switching question from your edit — don't lead with "switch to me." Lead with "what's not working with [current tool]?" If nothing's broken, they won't switch and that's fine. If something is, you just found your angle.

## r/ecommerce — Herderin (ratkissess)

## VERSION 1 (Recommended — leads with most actionable move)

I looked into your niche out of curiosity and there's a specific move I'd prioritize over everything else you're doing.

There are active, ranking blog posts with titles like "sustainable clothing brands for tall women" on sites like Conscious Life & Style, Tall Fashion Adventures, and PhD in Clothes. **Herderin isn't on any of them.** These articles get steady Google traffic from people searching for exactly what you sell. Email each blogger, introduce the brand, and ask to be included. This is free, takes an afternoon, and can send qualified traffic for months or years.

You mentioned you started Pinterest — good instinct. The platform is 85% female, higher income, and nobody owns "sustainable tall fashion" there yet. The key is pinning consistently with specific keywords ("tall women sustainable fashion," "ethical clothing for tall women") so you build a library that compounds over time. Pinterest is a search engine, not a social feed — treat it like SEO and it'll outperform Instagram for your niche.

One more — go find the Reddit threads in r/ethicalfashion and r/SustainableFashion where people literally ask "where can I find sustainable clothing for tall women?" The answers are thin. You ARE the answer. Respond genuinely (not salesy) and those threads get traffic for years.

Skip the broad SEO play for now. You don't need 50 blog posts. You need to show up in the 10-15 places where your exact customer is already looking and asking.

## VERSION 2 (More strategic — leads with positioning)

Ran some research on your niche because the positioning caught my eye. Here's what I noticed:

**Your differentiation is real but invisible.** Tall-centered design for 5'9"+ women, Climate Beneficial certified, regenerative fibers, Bay Area manufacturing, PhD expertise — I couldn't find another brand combining all of that. That's not a small thing. But it's buried on your site. A first-time visitor should get hit with that within 5 seconds. Right now they don't.

On traffic — you're spreading effort across too many channels. I'd narrow to two moves:

**1. Get on the listicles.** There are blog posts ranking on Google right now for "sustainable clothing for tall women" from sites like Conscious Life & Style and Tall Fashion Adventures. Herderin isn't mentioned in any of them. Email the authors. Introduce yourself. These lists send qualified traffic for years and getting added is free.

**2. Own Pinterest for your niche.** Nobody dominates "sustainable tall fashion" on Pinterest. The platform is 85% female, skews higher income, and is built for visual product discovery. Pin consistently with specific keywords. This compounds over time in a way Instagram never will.

Also worth knowing — people are asking on Reddit (r/ethicalfashion, r/SustainableFashion) for exactly what you make. Those threads have weak answers. Show up there authentically.

The blog posts, the SEO keyword pages, the five buyer personas — that's a lot of effort spread thin. Your customer is very specific. Go to where she's already searching and make sure Herderin shows up. That's it for now.

## VERSION 3 (Shortest, most direct)

I got curious and researched your niche. Three things I'd do before anything else:

**Get on the listicles.** Sites like Conscious Life & Style and Tall Fashion Adventures have posts ranking in Google for "sustainable tall clothing brands." Herderin isn't on them. Email the bloggers and ask to be included. Free, takes an afternoon, sends traffic for years.

**Move your best stuff above the fold.** Tall-centered + Climate Beneficial + regenerative fibers + Bay Area made is a combination I literally couldn't find anywhere else. That should be the first thing a visitor sees, not something they discover three clicks in.

**Pinterest over Instagram.** 85% female, higher income, fashion-focused. Nobody owns "sustainable tall fashion" there. Your products are made for that platform. Pin with specific keywords and let it compound.

Also — people in r/ethicalfashion are asking "where do I find sustainable clothing for tall women?" and getting weak answers. You're the answer. Show up in those threads.

You don't need more content. You need to be visible in the 10 places your customer is already looking.
