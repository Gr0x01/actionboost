# Content Plan — Herderin Reddit Interaction

## 1. Twitter Post (Today — standalone, no link)

Saw someone on Reddit asking how to drive traffic to her sustainable fashion brand. 30 visits/day, zero budget.

I ran my tool on her business and dropped the findings as a comment — no pitch, no CTA.

Specific blogs to pitch. Reddit threads where her exact customer is already asking for recommendations. Pinterest angles she hadn't tried.

Her reply: "I am going to spend tomorrow morning emailing these bloggers. This is such a great idea."

Best marketing for a marketing tool is just... using it.

### Self-reply (30 min later)

The tool is called Boost (aboo.st) if anyone's curious. Runs competitive analysis using real search data, not vibes.

But honestly the bigger lesson: go where your customers are asking questions and give them the answer. That's the whole game.

## 2. Twitter Thread (2-3 days later — use dashboard screenshots)

**[1/5]**
I helped a stranger on Reddit grow her business yesterday.

Here's exactly what I found and how — because the process matters more than the tool.

**[2/5]**
She runs a sustainable fashion brand for tall women. Niche product, real demand, but only 30 visits/day and no budget.

First thing I looked at: who's already ranking for her keywords and how much traffic they get.

**[3/5]**
Then I looked at where her customers actually hang out online.

Turns out there are Reddit threads — right now — where tall women are asking "where do I find sustainable clothes that fit?"

She literally has the answer. She just wasn't there.

**[4/5]**
I also found listicle blogs ranking for "sustainable fashion brands" and "clothing for tall women" that she could pitch for inclusion. Free backlinks, free traffic, high intent.

None of this is genius. It's just looking at the data instead of guessing.

**[5/5]**
Her response: "I will do exactly as you say here. I am going to spend tomorrow morning emailing these bloggers."

That's the whole point of what I'm building with Boost. Not a 50-page report. Stuff you can act on tomorrow morning.

## 3. Reddit Post on r/SaaS or r/indiehackers (4-5 days later)

**Title**: I helped a stranger on Reddit using my product. She took action the next morning. Best marketing I've ever done.

I'm building Boost — a marketing research tool that runs competitive analysis on businesses using AI + real data sources.

A woman posted on r/ecommerce asking how to drive traffic. She runs a niche sustainable fashion brand, gets 30 visits/day, and explicitly said "this is not an opening to work with anyone."

So I didn't pitch her anything. I ran a Boost on her business and posted the findings as a Reddit comment. Specific stuff:

- Listicle blogs ranking for her keywords that she could pitch for backlink inclusion
- Reddit threads where tall women are literally asking for product recommendations she could answer
- Pinterest strategy based on what's actually working in her space

Her response (paraphrasing): "I'm spending tomorrow morning emailing these bloggers. This feels like Day 1."

No one asked me to do this. I just thought her business was interesting and wanted to see what my tool would find.

Three things I learned:

1. The best demo is solving a real person's real problem in public
2. "Show don't tell" actually works when the output is genuinely useful
3. Going where your customers already are (Reddit, forums) and being helpful without an agenda is the most underrated growth channel

I'm not posting this to be self-congratulatory. I'm posting it because I spent weeks overthinking my launch strategy when the answer was this simple: find people who need what you built and help them.

Happy to answer questions about the tool or the approach.

## 4. Repeatable Loop

Do this once a week:

1. Find Reddit posts where someone is stuck with a marketing problem
2. Run a Boost on their business
3. Post the findings as a helpful comment (no pitch)
4. Screenshot the interaction and the dashboard output
5. Turn it into a Twitter post

After 5-6 of these, you have a portfolio of real results.

## Guardrails

- Do NOT name her business or show her username in tweets unless she agrees
- Do NOT frame as a case study — frame as a story
- Do NOT screenshot her comment with username visible
- Use "sustainable fashion brand for tall women" — specific enough to be credible, vague enough to be respectful
