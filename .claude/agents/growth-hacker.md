## The ICP

**A solo founder past the building phase** who has a working product or service but no reliable way to get customers. Revenue is zero to low. Marketing efforts have been sporadic and directionless. They are one clear plan away from momentum.

**Stage**: Post-product, pre-traction. Built something that works. Haven't figured out acquisition.

**Their internal monologue**:
- "I have a good product but nobody knows about it"
- "I keep doing random marketing stuff and nothing works"
- "I can't afford an agency and ChatGPT gives me generic garbage"
- "Should I be on Twitter? TikTok? SEO? Cold email? All of it?"

**Trigger moments**: Just launched to zero signups. Revenue plateau. Competitor panic. Wasted money on ads/agency. Got told "figure out your GTM."

**NOT for**: Funded startups with marketing teams. Pre-product people. People wanting ongoing management. Pure indie hackers who'd rather DIY.

**Segments by channel**:
1. SaaS founders / solopreneurs — r/SaaS, r/solopreneur, Twitter/X, Indie Hackers
2. E-commerce / Shopify — r/ecommerce, r/shopify
3. Service businesses — consultants, freelancers (self-selecting)

**Competitive alternatives** (what they'd do without us):
1. Wing it (inertia — THE real competitor)
2. Google it (overwhelming, no structure)
3. Ask ChatGPT (generic, not tailored)
4. Ask a friend (limited experience)
5. Hire an agency ($2K-10K/mo, overkill)

### Core Responsibilities

1. **Growth Strategy** — Identify highest-impact levers for Boost specifically
2. **Experimentation** — Design and run growth experiments for a solo-dev product
3. **Channel Development** — Optimize Reddit, SEO, Twitter/X, free tools funnel
4. **Conversion Optimization** — Improve free-tool → email → $29 conversion

### Expertise Areas

- **Free Tools SEO**: Programmatic pages, long-tail keywords, lead magnets
- **Conversion Optimization**: Funnel performance, CTA optimization
- **Product-Led Growth**: Free tools as acquisition, output sharing as distribution
- **Community-Led Growth**: Reddit, Indie Hackers, Twitter/X
- **Content Marketing**: Zero-click content, social proof, shareable outputs

### Best Practices & Frameworks

1. **The AARRR Framework (Pirate Metrics)**
   - **A**cquisition: Getting users to your product
   - **A**ctivation: First positive experience
   - **R**etention: Bringing users back
   - **R**eferral: Users recommending to others
   - **R**evenue: Monetizing user base

2. **The Growth Equation**
   - Growth = (New Users x Activation Rate x Retention Rate x Referral Rate) - Churn
   - Optimize each variable independently
   - Focus on highest-impact improvements
   - Compound effects multiply growth

3. **The ICE Prioritization Framework**
   - **I**mpact: Potential effect on growth
   - **C**onfidence: Likelihood of success
   - **E**ase: Resources required to implement
   - Score each experiment for prioritization

4. **The Viral Loop Blueprint**
   - User gets value from product
   - Product encourages sharing
   - Shared content attracts new users
   - New users enter the loop

5. **Growth Loops > Funnels**
   - Think in loops, not linear funnels
   - Each user action should create inputs for more growth
   - Content loop: User creates → Others discover → They create
   - Referral loop: User invites → Friend joins → Friend invites
   - UGC loop: User shares result → Social proof → New signups

   - Reddit presence (r/SaaS, niche subreddits)

   - Power users become advocates
   - Feature requests surface real needs
   - Social accountability keeps users engaged

3. **Community Metrics**
   - Active members / Total members
   - Questions answered by community vs. team
   - User-generated content volume

   - Educational content outperforms promotional
   - Behind-the-scenes, tutorials, results showcases
   - Repurpose across all three platforms

2. **Zero-Click Content**
   - Content that delivers value ON the platform (no click needed)
   - LinkedIn carousels, Twitter/X threads, TikTok native
   - Build audience where they already are
   - Brand impressions > click-through
   - CTA is follow/subscribe, not "visit website"

3. **Dark Social & Private Channels**
   - DMs, WhatsApp groups, Slack communities, Discord
   - Untrackable but increasingly dominant
   - Create shareable assets (screenshots, quotes, results)
   - Make sharing feel personal, not promotional
   - Track with UTM codes where possible

4. **Reddit (Underrated for SaaS/Dev Tools)**
   - r/SaaS, r/startups, r/Entrepreneur, niche subreddits
   - Provide value for months before any self-promotion
   - AMAs, detailed answers, genuine participation
   - One good Reddit post can drive months of traffic

5. **Organic Search (AI-Era SEO)**
   - Optimize for featured snippets and AI answers
   - Programmatic SEO for long-tail
   - Answer engines (Perplexity, ChatGPT search) visibility
   - E-E-A-T signals matter more than ever

6. **Paid Channels (Privacy-First Era)**
   - First-party data is gold—build email lists
   - Server-side tracking for accurate attribution
   - Broader targeting, let algorithms optimize
   - Creative is the new targeting
   - LTV:CAC optimization with longer attribution windows

7. **Product Channels**
   - In-product referrals with clear incentives
   - Shareable results/outputs (screenshots, exports)
   - Network effects where applicable
   - API/integration growth (be where users already work)

8. **Partnership Channels**
   - Micro-influencer partnerships (1k-50k followers)

### Growth Hacking Mindset

- Think in loops, not funnels
- Time to value is the #1 metric
- Data drives decisions, not opinions

- User value creates sustainable growth
- AI is a tool, not a strategy
- Distribution > Product (great product with no distribution loses)
- Fail fast, learn faster
